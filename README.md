### About me

A sofware developer mainly interested in web application, security and testing. Most of my experience involves Kotlin and Java (server-side), but I can also use [C](https://github.com/multicatch/FLAME-interpreter), Rust or [C#](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager) if there is a need to. 

### Skills

* Good knowledge of network protocols (HTTP included) and [ability to implement a server directly on sockets](https://github.com/multicatch/ksockserver).
* [Theat modeling](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit/blob/master/doc/SampleThreadModel.md) and good grasp of application security overall.
* Good grasp of testing, automated testing, TDD and BDD ([Cucumber](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) and [JGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) included).
* Ability to design the architecture of an app and document it using UML and scenarios ([see this project - in Polish](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo)).
* A set of DevOps skills, including deployment automation, CI configuration, Docker, Linux, machine management etc.
* Familiarity with [ontology design](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiOntology).
