### About me

A sofware developer mainly interested in web application, security and testing. Most of my experience involves Kotlin and Java (server-side), but I am also familiar with [C](https://github.com/multicatch/FLAME-interpreter), [Rust](https://github.com/multicatch/rubble-rs) or [C#](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager).

### Skills

* [Theat modeling](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit/blob/master/doc/SampleThreadModel.md) and good grasp of application security overall.
* Good grasp of testing, automated testing, TDD and BDD ([Cucumber](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) and [JGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) included).
* Ability to design the architecture of an app and document it using UML and scenarios ([see this project - in Polish](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo)).
