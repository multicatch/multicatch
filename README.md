## About me

A sofware developer mainly interested in web application, security and testing. Most of my experience involves Kotlin and Java (server-side), but I am also familiar with Rust and [C](https://github.com/multicatch/FLAME-interpreter).

As for my DevOps skills - my newest repositories usually have a configured GitHub Actions pipeline, but I can also write a pipeline in Groovy for Jenkins.

### Language Experience (as of 2023)

* Java SE & JEE Development (6 years of work experience, in total 8 years of full-time & freelance experience)
* Kotlin Server-side Development (5 years of work experience)
* Rust (3 years)

### Certifications

* [![Oracle Certified Professional badge](oracle-certified-professional-java-se-11-developer.png)](https://www.credly.com/badges/b3aded34-b15a-44c7-9125-3f7600eca6a4/public_url) \
[Oracle Certified Professional: Java 11 SE Developer (1Z0-819-J) (2021)](https://www.credly.com/badges/b3aded34-b15a-44c7-9125-3f7600eca6a4/public_url)

### Skills

* Good knowledge of network protocols (HTTP included) so that I can implement [implement own HTTP/1.1 server directly on sockets](https://github.com/multicatch/ksockserver).
* [Theat modeling](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit/blob/master/doc/SampleThreadModel.md) and good grasp of application security overall.
* Good grasp of testing, automated testing, TDD and BDD ([Cucumber](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) and [JGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) included).
* Ability to design the architecture of an app and document it using UML and scenarios ([see this project - in Polish](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo)).
* A set of DevOps skills, including deployment automation, CI configuration, Docker (and Docker Compose), Linux (and Bash scripting), machine management etc.
* A good grasp of [ontology design](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiOntology) and [Apache Jena](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiWikiGenerator).

## Some projects of mine

*Note: In some of the older project my name can be set as SudoWaster - this is my old GitHub's name.*

### Kotlin

* [cucumber-audit](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) - a pentesting tool that uses Selenium and Cucumber; it can be used to create scenarios based on a threat model that will be automatically validated and used to generate reports of exsiting threats (sample usage included in repo). Published at [OSSRH](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~io.github.multicatch~cucumber-audit*~~~) and available from [Maven Repositories](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.multicatch).
* [ksockserver](https://github.com/multicatch/ksockserver) - a framework for creating custom web servers in Kotlin, with an example HTTP/1.1 server.
* [FuddiWikiGenerator](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiWikiGenerator) - a tool to generate wiki pages from an ontology using a given template file.
* [Papajbot-messenger](https://github.com/multicatch/Papajbot-messenger) - a custom Messenger API client that can be used as a framework for building chatbots in Kotlin (tested to be working).

### Rust 

* [kafka-json-processor](https://github.com/multicatch/kafka-json-processor) - A processor that reads JSONs from Kafka topics, processes them and puts them in other selected Kafka topic. 
* [appium-client](https://github.com/multicatch/kafka-json-processor) - Rust client for Appium, for automated mobile app testing. 
* [rubble-templates](https://github.com/multicatch/rubble-rs) - a templating engine in Rust indended to be used to interpolate text with custom extendable syntax. Published at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rubble-templates).
* [axxd](https://github.com/multicatch/axxd) - an axx file decryption tool. This tool can decrypt AxCrypt-encrypted files.

### Java/JEE

* [java-logger-benchmark](https://github.com/multicatch/java-logger-benchmark) - a benchmark of a few most popular logging libraries in Java, with a complete report.
* [NuciferaChat](https://github.com/multicatch/Nucifera-Chat) - my attempt at making my custom chat server in JEE with my custom encryption, tested to be working on Glassfish.
* [MockGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) - my testing tool to make mocking and testing with BDD quicker (with scenarios defined in code, not in external files like in Cucumber).
* [zoo](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo) - a project I made for my software engineering classes that presents a sample use of UML.

### C#

* [ProjectManager](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager) - a simple app for project management with React front-end.

### JavaScript

* [Erebor](https://github.com/multicatch/Erebor) - a custom responsive client of UMCS Moria timetable written in React ([live here](https://erebor.vpcloud.eu/)).
* [Syjonizer](https://github.com/multicatch/Syjonizer) - a plugin for Firefox and Chrome to make UMCS Moria timetable more easy to use (currently discontinued in favor of a [Erebor](https://github.com/multicatch/Erebor)).
* [ProjectManager](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager) - the front-end for this project management tool is written in React.
