## About me

A sofware developer mainly interested in web application, security and testing. Most of my experience involves Kotlin and Java (server-side), but I am also familiar with [C](https://github.com/multicatch/FLAME-interpreter), [Rust](https://github.com/multicatch/rubble-rs) or [C#](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager).

### Language Experience

* Java SE & JEE Development (3 years of work experience, in total 6 years of work & learning experience)
* Kotlin Server-side Development (2 years)

### Certifications

* Oracle Certified Professional: Java 11 SE Developer (1Z0-819-J) (2021)

### Skills

* Good knowledge of network protocols (HTTP included) so that I can implement [implement own HTTP/1.1 server directly on sockets](https://github.com/multicatch/ksockserver).
* [Theat modeling](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit/blob/master/doc/SampleThreadModel.md) and good grasp of application security overall.
* Good grasp of testing, automated testing, TDD and BDD ([Cucumber](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) and [JGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) included).
* Ability to design the architecture of an app and document it using UML and scenarios ([see this project - in Polish](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo)).
* A set of DevOps skills, including deployment automation, CI configuration, Docker (and Docker Compose), Linux (and Bash scripting), machine management etc.
* A good grasp of [ontology design](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiOntology) and [Apache Jena](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiWikiGenerator).

## Some projects of mine

*Note: In some of the older project my name can be set as SudoWaster - this is my old GitHub's name.*

### Java/JEE

* [NuciferaChat](https://github.com/multicatch/Nucifera-Chat) - my attempt at making my custom chat server in JEE with my custom encryption, tested to be working on Glassfish.
* [MockGiven](https://github.com/multicatch/MockGiven) - my testing tool to make mocking and testing with BDD quicker (with scenarios defined in code, not in external files like in Cucumber).
* [zoo](https://github.com/multicatch/zoo) - a project I made for my software engineering classes that presents a sample use of UML.

### Kotlin

* [cucumber-audit](https://github.com/multicatch/cucumber-audit) - a pentesting tool that uses Selenium and Cucumber; it can be used to create scenarios based on a threat model that will be automatically validated and used to generate reports of exsiting threats (sample usage included in repo). Published at [OSSRH](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;gav~io.github.multicatch~cucumber-audit*~~~) and available from [Maven Repositories](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.multicatch).
* [ksockserver](https://github.com/multicatch/ksockserver) - a framework for creating custom web servers in Kotlin, with an example HTTP/1.1 server.
* [FuddiWikiGenerator](https://github.com/multicatch/FuddiWikiGenerator) - a tool to generate wiki pages from an ontology using a given template file.
* [Papajbot-messenger](https://github.com/multicatch/Papajbot-messenger) - a custom Messenger API client that can be used as a framework for building chatbots in Kotlin (tested to be working).

### Rust 

* [rubble-templates](https://github.com/multicatch/rubble-rs) - a templating engine in Rust indended to be used to replace patterns in text with custom extendable syntax (using custom language in templates that will be evaluated using an interpreted). Published at [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rubble-templates).

### C#

* [ProjectManager](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager) - a simple app for project management with React front-end.

### JavaScript

* [Erebor](https://github.com/multicatch/Erebor) - a custom responsive client of UMCS Moria timetable written in React ([live here](https://erebor.vpcloud.eu/)).
* [Syjonizer](https://github.com/multicatch/Syjonizer) - a plugin for Firefox and Chrome to make UMCS Moria timetable more easy to use (currently discontinued in favor of a [Erebor](https://github.com/multicatch/Erebor)).
* [ProjectManager](https://github.com/multicatch/ProjectManager) - the front-end for this project management tool is written in React.
